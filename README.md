# Multilevel-Evolution

Simulation files for a model of multilevel evolution. Primary result is reproductive division of labour given sufficient number of cells per organism.
There are two modes of reproduction, each in an independent source file (budding and fission).
In the fission model, organisms reproduce by splitting into two.
In the bud model, organisms reproduce by producing propagules/buds.
Compile each separately.

# Multilevel-Evolution

Simulation files for a model of multilevel evolution of cells within an organism. Primary model files are in src (fission.cpp, budding.cpp). In the fission model, organisms reproduce by splitting into two. In the bud model, organisms reproduce by producing propagules/buds. Compiled separately.

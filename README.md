# Multilevel-Evolution

Simulation files for a model of multilevel evolution. Primary result is reproductive division of labour given sufficient number of cells per organism. These files are in src. In the fission model, organisms reproduce by splitting into two. In the bud model, organisms reproduce by producing propagules/buds. Compiled separately.
